        <Card text='# The Illusion of Progress in Modern Technology

Technology advances rapidlyâ€”faster processors, smarter AI, thinner phones. But are these truly signs of progress?

## Convenience vs. Dependence

While devices make life easier, they also make users dependent. A simple GPS error today can paralyze a driver. Is this empowerment, or a quiet erosion of basic skills?

## Productivity or Distraction?

We were promised productivity, yet attention spans are shorter, and constant notifications fragment focus. Technology may streamline tasks, but it also manufactures distractions.

## Who Really Benefits?

Progress often favors corporations more than individuals. Data harvesting, planned obsolescence, and algorithmic manipulation suggest users are products, not customers.

## Conclusion

The narrative of progress is seductive, but needs scrutiny. Not all innovation is improvement. True progress should enhance autonomy, not undermine it.
