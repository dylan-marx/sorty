# Sorty

A drag-and-drop UI for manually classifying text data from CSVs.


### **Stack**

* **Frontend**: React (TypeScript), HTML, CSS
* **Backend**: Flask (Python)
* **Data**: CSVs handled with Pandas

## Objective

Create a web-based UI to classify text-based cards into categories. Card data is loaded from CSV files and user classifications are written back into output CSV.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git

### Configuration

* Categories should be defined in a **config.json** file (loaded at runtime), e.g.:

```json
{
  "categories": ["Positive", "Negative", "Neutral", "Question", "Off-topic"]
}
```

* Add the data you wish to label in the **data** folder and name it **data.csv**

---

###  **CSV Structure**

* **data.csv**:

  * Contains all unclassified items, e.g.

    | id | text            |
    | -- | --------------- |
    | 1  | "Great product" |

* **classification.csv**

    * Contains the id and the category

      | id | category  |
      |----|-----------|
      | 1  | Positive  |
